### Still unfinished!!

# Kah
Kah is template filler. You create your templates in [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)  and kah will parse out each section so it can easily be filled out by someone without html knowledge. It uses a [medium style editor](https://github.com/FranzSkuffka/vue-medium-editor) to make it easier to format the text.

## Why?

I maintain a site with many pages which follow the identical structure. I wanted to make a program which could let the content creators make the pages from content to html, so I created this little tool.
